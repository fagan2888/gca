Version 0.11 Release Notes
--------------------------

There were some files missing from the previous release. This release updates the previous with those files. Many thanks to Michael Rudzsky for notifying me that files were missing and helping identify which ones.

Additionally for MATLAB version 7.0 the form of the C++ files has been updated for easier compilation.
